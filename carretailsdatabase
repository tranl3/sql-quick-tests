### Question 1

In the table products at the car retailer database [database file: classicmodels (using PCs in the lab).sql], we can see buyPrice [the price that the company used to buy products], and MSRP [Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price]. 
We assume that the difference between buyPrice and MSRP [MSRP - buyPrice] is the expected profit per product. 
So, for the cars produced by the “Classic Cars” productLine, what is the name of the product that generates the highest total expected profit?

The total expected profit = quantityInStock * expected profit per product.

_The MySQL code that generates the result:_

SELECT productName,
ROUND(SUM(quantityInStock*(MSRP - buyPrice)), 1)
AS Total_expected_profit
FROM products
WHERE productLine='Classic Cars'
GROUP BY productName
ORDER BY Total_expected_profit DESC;

### Question 2

In the table orders at the car retailer database, what is the customerNumber of the customer who has the highest frequency of placing orders to the company in 2004 [orderDate in 2004]?
You don’t need to consider whether the products have been finally shipped or not.

_The MySQL code that generates the result:_

SELECT customerNumber, COUNT(*) AS freq FROM orders
WHERE YEAR(orderDate)=2004
GROUP BY customerNumber
ORDER BY freq DESC;

### Question 3

In the car retails database, please find the name of the product that generates most profit for the company (10 points). Assume all the orders were accepted and shipped with no cancellation!

_The MySQL code that generates the result:_

SELECT t1.productName,
ROUND(SUM((t2.priceEach-t1.buyPrice)*t2.quantityOrdered), 2) AS profit
FROM products AS t1
JOIN orderdetails AS t2
ON t1.productCode=t2.productCode
GROUP BY t1.productName
ORDER BY profit DESC;
