In the table products at the car retailer database [database file: classicmodels (using PCs in the lab).sql], we can see buyPrice [the price that the company used to buy products], and MSRP [Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price]. 
We assume that the difference between buyPrice and MSRP [MSRP - buyPrice] is the expected profit per product. 
So, for the cars produced by the “Classic Cars” productLine, what is the name of the product that generates the highest total expected profit?

The total expected profit = quantityInStock * expected profit per product.

The MySQL code that generates the result:

SELECT productName,
ROUND(SUM(quantityInStock*(MSRP - buyPrice)), 1)
AS Total_expected_profit
FROM products
WHERE productLine='Classic Cars'
GROUP BY productName
ORDER BY Total_expected_profit DESC;
