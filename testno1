In the table products at the car retailer database [database file: classicmodels (using PCs in the lab).sql], we can see buyPrice [the price that the company used to buy products], and MSRP [Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price]. 
We assume that the difference between buyPrice and MSRP [MSRP - buyPrice] is the expected profit per product. 
So, for the cars produced by the “Classic Cars” productLine, what is the name of the product that generates the highest total expected profit?
