Based on the use of cfpb consumer complaint database (2500 rows), please count the frequency the complaints that satisfy the following three conditions at the same time: 
i) consumer finally disputed with the company (Consumer_disputed); and 
ii) were received on Friday (Data_received); and 
iii) the difference between Data_received and Data_sent_to_company is more than 5 days.

_The MySQL code that generates the result:_

SELECT company, COUNT(*) AS freq
FROM cfpb_complaints_2500
WHERE Consumer_disputed='Yes' AND DAYNAME(Data_received)='Friday'
AND DATEDIFF(Data_sent_to_company, Data_received)>5
GROUP BY company
ORDER BY freq DESC;
