In the Chile database, letâ€™s assume that an income less than 10,000 is a low_income; an income between 10,000 and 100,000 is a middle_income; an income higher than 100,000 is a high_income. 
For females who voted yes to Pinochet, whether their income level is associated with their statusquo? 

_The MySQL code that generates the result:_

ALTER TABLE chile ADD Income_level VARCHAR(15);
UPDATE chile SET Income_level=CASE
WHEN income<10000 THEN 'Low_income'
WHEN income>100000 THEN 'High_income'
ELSE 'Middle_income'
END;
SELECT Income_level, ROUND(AVG(statusquo), 3) AS Mean_statusquo
FROM chile
WHERE sex='F' AND vote='Y'
GROUP BY Income_level
ORDER BY Mean_statusquo DESC;
